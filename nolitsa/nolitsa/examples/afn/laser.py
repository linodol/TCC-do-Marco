"""AFN for time series from a far-infrared laser.

The time series is from Data Set A of the Sata Fe Time Series
Competition.  This is a map-like data from a far-infrared laser.

Since each value of the time series is an 8-bit integer (i.e., it's in
the range [0, 255]), the reconstructed phase space is essentially a grid
with zero dimension.  To actually measure the dimension of this data
set, we have to "kick" points off the grid a little bit by adding an
insignificant amount of noise.  See Example 6.4 in Kantz & Schreiber
(2004).

From the E1(d) curve, one concludes that the minimum embedding dimension
should be close to 8 [Cao (1997) reports 7 as the minimum embedding
dimension].  This is somewhat surprising since this series has a very
low correlation dimension (near 2.0).
