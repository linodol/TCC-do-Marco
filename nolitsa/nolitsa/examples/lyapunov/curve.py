"""Maximum Lyapunov exponent of a closed noisy curve.

A trajectory in the form of a closed curve should have a Lyapunov
exponent equal to zero (or the average divergence should not vary with
time).  But our curves for the average divergence appear to be
oscillatory and don't look very flat.  What's wrong?
